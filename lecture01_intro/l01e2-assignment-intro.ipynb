    "## I. Data Driven Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the story of Signet Bank. At the time, credit cards essentially had uniform pricing. Modeling the probability of default had changed the industry (customers where either offered a credit card, if their probability of default was low enough, or not). Around 1990, two strategic visionaries (Richard Fairbanks and Nigel Morris) realized that information technology was powerful enough that they could do more sophisticated predictive modeling and offer different terms (nowadays: pricing, credit limits, low-initial-rate balance transfers, cash back, loyalty points, and so on) to different customers. Signet Bank’s management was convinced that modeling profitability, not just default probability, was the right strategy. They knew that a small proportion of customers actually account for more than 100% of a bank’s profit from credit card operations (because the rest are break-even or money-losing). If they could model profitability, they could make better offers to the best customers and “skim the cream” of the big banks’ clientele.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Signet Bank had one really big problem in implementing this strategy. They did not have the appropriate data to model profitability with the goal of offering different terms to different customers. No one did. Since banks were offering credit with a specific set of terms and a specific default model, they had the data to model profitability (1) for the terms they actually have offered in the past, and (2) for the sort of customer who was actually offered credit (that is, those who were deemed worthy of credit by the existing model).\n",
    "\n",
    "What could Signet Bank do? They brought into play a fundamental strategy of data science: acquire the necessary data at a cost. Once we view data as a business asset, we should think about whether and how much we are willing to invest. In Signet’s case, data could be generated on the profitability of customers given different credit terms by conducting experiments. Different terms were offered at random to different customers. This may seem foolish outside the context of data-analytic thinking: you’re likely to lose money! This is true. In this case, losses are the cost of data acquisition. The data- analytic thinker needs to consider whether she expects the data to have sufficient value to justify the investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what happened with Signet Bank? As you might expect, when Signet began randomly offering terms to customers for data acquisition, the number of bad accounts soared. Signet went from an industry-leading “charge-off ” rate (2.9% of balances went unpaid) to almost 6% charge-offs. Losses continued for a few years while the data scientists worked to build predictive models from the data, evaluate them, and deploy them to improve profit. Because the firm viewed these losses as investments in data, they persisted despite complaints from stakeholders. Eventually, Signet’s credit card operation turned around and became so profitable that it was spun off to separate it from the bank’s other operations, which now were overshadowing the consumer credit success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairbanks and Morris became Chairman and CEO and President and COO, and proceeded to apply data science principles throughout the business — not just customer acquisition but retention as well. When a customer calls looking for a better offer, data-driven models calculate the potential profitability of various possible actions (different offers, including sticking with the status quo), and the customer service representative’s computer presents the best offers to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not have heard of little Signet Bank, but you may have heard of the spin-off: Capital One. Fairbanks and Morris’s new company grew to be one of the largest credit card issuers in the industry with one of the lowest charge-off rates. In 2000, the bank was reported to be carrying out 45,000 of these “scientific tests” as they called them.\n",

Thus, cells are on one hand executed multiple times and on the other hand, the Notebook is not linear in time anymore. We can always make it linear in space and time by using the \"Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Run All Cells\" command - but we do not want to do this too frequently, as it is pretty slow (esp. if there is some expensive data preprocessing earlier in the notebook). We can, however, ensure linearity in time by coding carefully!"
