    "- Create a rocket and print the values for the attributes you have created, to show they have been set correctly.\n",
    "- Create a small fleet of rockets, and set different values for one of the attributes you have created. Print the values of these attributes for each rocket in your fleet, to show that they have been set properly for each rocket.\n",
    "- If you are not sure what kind of attributes to add, you could consider storing the height of the rocket, the crew size, the name of the rocket, the speed of the rocket, or many other possible characteristics of a rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a new method to the class.\n",
    "    - Think of what rockets do, and make a very simple version of that behavior using print statements. For example, rockets lift off when they are launched. You could make a method called *launch()*, and all it would do is print a statement such as \"The rocket has lifted off!\" If your rocket has a name, this sentence could be more descriptive.\n",
    "    - You could make a very simple *land_rocket()* method that simply sets the x and y values of the rocket back to 0. Print the position before and after calling the *land_rocket()* method to make sure your method is doing what it's supposed to.\n",
    "    - If you enjoy working with math, you could implement a *safety_check()* method. This method would take in another rocket object, and call the get_distance() method on that rocket. Then it would check if that rocket is too close, and print a warning message if the rocket is too close. If there is zero distance between the two rockets, your method could print a message such as, \"The rockets have crashed!\" (Be careful; getting a zero distance could mean that you accidentally found the distance between a rocket and itself, rather than a second rocket.)\n",

    "    - In the \\_\\_init()\\_\\_ function, define several attributes of a person. Good attributes to consider are name, age, place of birth, and anything else you like to know about the people in your life.\n",
    "    - Write one method. This could be as simple as *introduce_yourself()*. This method would print out a statement such as, \"Hello, my name is Eric.\"\n",
    "    - You could also make a method such as *age_person()*. A simple version of this method would just add 1 to the person's age.\n",
    "        - A more complicated version of this method would involve storing the person's birthdate rather than their age, and then calculating the age whenever the age is requested. But dealing with dates and times is not particularly easy if you've never done it in any other programming language before.\n",
    "    - Create a person, set the attribute values appropriately, and print out information about the person.\n",

    "One of the most important goals of the object-oriented approach to programming is the creation of stable, reliable, reusable code. If you had to create a new class for every kind of object you wanted to model, you would hardly have any reusable code. In Python and any other language that supports OOP, one class can **inherit** from another class. This means you can base a new class on an existing class; the new class *inherits* all of the attributes and behavior of the class it is based on. A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can add any new attributes or behavior that are appropriate. The original class is called the **parent** class, and the new class is a **child** of the parent class. The parent class is also called a **superclass**, and the child class is also called a **subclass**.\n",
