    "- Create a rocket and print the values for the attributes you have created, to show they have been set correctly.\n",
    "- Create a small fleet of rockets, and set different values for one of the attributes you have created. Print the values of these attributes for each rocket in your fleet, to show that they have been set properly for each rocket.\n",

You could make a method called *launch()*, and all it would do is print a statement such as \"The rocket has lifted off!\" If your rocket has a name, this sentence could be more descriptive.\n",
    "    - You could make a very simple *land_rocket()* method that simply sets the x and y values of the rocket back to 0. Print the position before and after calling the *land_rocket()* method to make sure your method is doing what it's supposed to.\n",
    "    - If you enjoy working with math, you could implement a *safety_check()* method. This method would take in another rocket object, and call the get_distance() method on that rocket. Then it would check if that rocket is too close, and print a warning message if the rocket is too close. If there is zero distance between the two rockets, your method could print a message such as, \"The rockets have crashed!\" (Be careful; getting a zero distance could mean that you accidentally found the distance between a rocket and itself, rather than a second rocket.)\n",

If you had to create a new class for every kind of object you wanted to model, you would hardly have any reusable code. In Python and any other language that supports OOP, one class can **inherit** from another class. This means you can base a new class on an existing class; the new class *inherits* all of the attributes and behavior of the class it is based on. A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can add any new attributes or behavior that are appropriate. The original class is called the **parent** class, and the new class is a **child** of the parent class. The parent class is also called a **superclass**, and the child class is also called a **subclass**.\n",
